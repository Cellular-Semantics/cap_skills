"""Deterministic graders for the eval cases.

Pure functions over a captured run, so they are unit-tested without touching the
network or spending anything. `runner.py` does the subprocess work and calls in
here to score.

Each check is a dict with a `kind` and a `why` explaining what behaviour it pins.
A check that cannot be expressed deterministically belongs in the case's
`graders/criteria.md` instead, for an LLM grader to judge.
